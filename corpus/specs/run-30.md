## Objective success (machine-checked; NOT agent self-report)
verification: at base_commit, apply the agent's final patch; the FAIL_TO_PASS tests must go
              fail->pass AND all PASS_TO_PASS tests must remain passing (standard SWE-bench eval).
FAIL_TO_PASS:
  - test_memoryview_content (httpwrappers.tests.HttpResponseTests)
PASS_TO_PASS_count: 64
PASS_TO_PASS_sha256: sha256:9dc557cb7598ef0f0ddec67d261f495e67109e831dc3444167f794ebec561f88

## Fixed run parameters (frozen before the run)
turn_or_walltime_budget: 40 agent turns OR 20 min wall, whichever first

## Prompt (verbatim issue text the agent sees)
HttpResponse doesn't handle memoryview objects
Description
	
I am trying to write a BinaryField retrieved from the database into a HttpResponse. When the database is Sqlite this works correctly, but Postgresql returns the contents of the field as a memoryview object and it seems like current Django doesn't like this combination:
from django.http import HttpResponse																	 
# String content
response = HttpResponse("My Content")																			
response.content																								 
# Out: b'My Content'
# This is correct
# Bytes content
response = HttpResponse(b"My Content")																		 
response.content																								 
# Out: b'My Content'
# This is also correct
# memoryview content
response = HttpResponse(memoryview(b"My Content"))															 
response.content
# Out: b'<memory at 0x7fcc47ab2648>'
# This is not correct, I am expecting b'My Content'
