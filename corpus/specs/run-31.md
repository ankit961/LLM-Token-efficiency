## Objective success (machine-checked; NOT agent self-report)
verification: at base_commit, apply the agent's final patch; the FAIL_TO_PASS tests must go
              fail->pass AND all PASS_TO_PASS tests must remain passing (standard SWE-bench eval).
# FAIL_TO_PASS entries are preserved VERBATIM from upstream SWE-bench Verified; some read like
# prose but are genuine upstream evaluation directives -- never 'clean' them.
FAIL_TO_PASS:
  - test_real_apps_non_set (migrations.test_state.StateTests)
PASS_TO_PASS_count: 64
PASS_TO_PASS_sha256: sha256:3238632a9ddbacdc98cf2b8d8ac65726fe0541b0a868d142bfa444a58071c2d6

## Prompt (verbatim issue text the agent sees)
ProjectState.__init__() can assume its real_apps argument is a set
Description
	
​PR #14760 made all calls to ProjectState.__init__() pass real_apps as a set. In ​ProjectState.__init__() now, then, instead of checking that real_apps is a set and converting it to a set if not, it can just assert that it's a set when non-None. (Presumably the construction of new ProjectState objects is part of Django's internal API.) I had made this comment on the PR, but it wasn't important enough to hold up the PR because another PR was depending on it getting merged.
