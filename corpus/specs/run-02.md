fix_shape_evidence: n_src_files=2, src_lines=35   # blind to reads

## Objective success (machine-checked; NOT agent self-report)
verification: at base_commit, apply the agent's final patch; the FAIL_TO_PASS tests must go
              fail->pass AND all PASS_TO_PASS tests must remain passing (standard SWE-bench eval).
# FAIL_TO_PASS entries are preserved VERBATIM from upstream SWE-bench Verified; some read like
# prose but are genuine upstream evaluation directives -- never 'clean' them.
FAIL_TO_PASS:
  - test_alter_field_choices_noop (schema.tests.SchemaTests)
PASS_TO_PASS_count: 141
PASS_TO_PASS_sha256: sha256:482c6665ecbc9bb26135120f0af1bb6edb7da23207658f15f328b78620a8890d

## Fixed run parameters (frozen before the run)
turn_or_walltime_budget: 40 agent turns OR 20 min wall, whichever first
permission_mode: bypassPermissions
headless_or_interactive: headless
runtime: obs-runtime-3a-v1 (484f4b3)

## Prompt (verbatim issue text the agent sees)
AlterField operation should be noop when adding/changing choices on SQLite.
Description
	
while writing a test case for #33470 i found that for sqlite, even a seemingly db-transparent change like adding choices still generates sql (new table + insert + drop + rename) even though this shouldn't be needed. on e.g. postgres the same migration generates no sql
